There are no real deployment scripts at the moment, but I managed to create fully non-interactive installation scripts.

1. Clone this repository on the target server: `git clone https://github.com/amwolff/health-demo.git`;
2. `cd health-demo/deployment/bare-metal/manual && sudo bash ./install.bash`;
3. After the installation finishes - GNU Health should be installed for the new `gnuhealth` user.
